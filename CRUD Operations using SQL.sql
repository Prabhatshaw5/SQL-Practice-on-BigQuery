/*Step 1: Let's create a new database called Loans_db
*/

create database loans_db;

/*Make the new database as the default database*/
USE Loans_db;

/*Let's see if we have any tables in the database*/
Show tables;

/*Let's create a new table in the loans_db*/
CREATE TABLE customers(custId INTEGER,
custName char(100),
gender char(10),
income integer,
dob date,
credit_history boolean
);

describe customers; /*Show the metadata (or data dictionary) of this table*/

/*CRUD Operations:
Create -> Create database / table
Read -> Select
Add Rows -> INSERT
Update - Update
Delete - Delete*/

select custName, gender, income, dob, credit_history 
from customers;

select * /*select all the columns.*/
from customers;

/*How to insert rows into a table?*/
INSERT INTO customers(custId, custName, gender, income, dob, credit_history)
VALUES
(101, "Deepak Raj", "Male", 9999999, "1999-12-05", TRUE),

/*Delete rows /records*/

/*You're not allowed to delete or update without where conditions*/
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATEs = 0; /*Disables the unconditonal delete / update restriction*/

/*delete rows conditionally*/

/*Update -> modify existing data (eg somebody's last name)*/
Update customers

select * from customers;

/*Practice questions:
1. Create a new table called materials with the following structure and data:
MaterialID | MaterialName | UnitCost | PriceDate  | IsAvailableInIndia
1          | Steel        | 5        | 2023-12-08 | TRUE
2          | Plastic      | 2        | 2023-11-02 | TRUE
3          | Aluminum     | 4        | 2023-10-23 | TRUE
4          | Rubber       | 1.5      | 2024-04-19 | FALSE
5          | Copper       | 6        | 2024-05-08 | FALSE

2. Change the UnitCost to 1.8 for MaterialID 4
3. Add a new row with MaterialID 6, MaterialName 'Glass', UnitCost 3, PriceDate '2024-06-15', IsAvailableInIndia TRUE    
4. Delete the material details of MaterialID 6

-- Bonus Assignment -- 
1. Create a new table called as loans with the following 
structure and data: 
loan_ID | loan_amt	| custID
1			43434	  101
2			4222	  201
3			66533	  101

2. Change the loan_amt to 5555 for loan_Id 2
3. Add a new row with loan_ID 4, loan_amt 666, custId 201	
4. Delete the loan details of loan_ID 4
